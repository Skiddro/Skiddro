# Hey there! I'm `Skiddro`!



# Who am I?
Prepare to read a short and dumb about-me.

I'm just a guy with ADHD who knows a bunch about computers and uses ChatGPT to modify code because I'm too lazy to learn how to code, and lots of ideas in my head!

I have about 8 years of experience with computer software and (some) hardware, including a year of experience with using AI.

# What I work on.

I am currently working on multiple projects. A few of them are below.

- BunkerStop - A proprietary revival project to combine and revive at the same time two Roblox games into one single game. Those games being `Bus Stop Simulator` and `Bunker.JPEG`.

- SkiddroNG - A soon-to-be-open-source-and-released fork of WoeUSB-NG where it's code has been converted from Python to C++.

- UEFIParted - My own Debian-based live distro made from scratch that is similar to GParted's live distro. I created it due to the fact it looks and seems to be very old, and it does not boot on UEFI-based systems. I'll release it's source code and stuff to GitHub if I can.

- ViPER4PC - A fork of ViPERFX_RE to attempt to get ViPER4Android/ViPERFX_RE available on Windows and Linux. Currently in very early development.

# What I worked on. (No longer work on)

- A revival project where Vib-Ribbon, a PlayStation 1 game from 1991, was going to be remade from scratch for PC and some consoles. It was cancelled due to development issues and drama within the development team.

- BurialLinux/KodiakOS - An attempt to make an all-in-one operating system where Windows, MacOS, Android, etc programs and apps would run natively without requriing programs like Wine and such. No progress was made at all for the operating system except for some prototype sounds.

- RSINFS (RoSolder Is Not For Skids) - A script executor for Roblox for ethical exploit/vulnerability discovery purposes that would've been forked from SynapseX's leaked source code. Work was going to be actually done to make this project come to life, but I decided that it wasn't worth my time, and I do not have the skills/knowledge to make executors and such.

# FAQ

Q: Are you a skid (script-kiddie)?

A: I used to be, but that was back in 2020 and earlier. My name is "Skiddro" simply because I like the name, and it's also a reference to Squidward saying "Hold on there, Jeffro!" in the Pizza Delivery episode.

Q: Why not take the time to learn how to code instead of using ChatGPT?

A: Welcome to me and ADHD in general. I don't have the patience and time to learn how to code sadly.

Q: How can I contact you?

A: If possible, contact this GitHub account or post an issue form or whatever on this README.

# That's all for now!
## Have a good day!
